   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `S<u32>: TreeKey`
           which is required by `&S<u32>: TreeKey`
           `S<u32>: TreeKey`

note: the trait `TreeKey` must be implemented

   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `traverse_all`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `TreeKey`
